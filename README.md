# Linux shell

## Shell basics

In this project we work shell commands.
Shell comands project. The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

## Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this lesson, we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection. As we have seen, many commands such as ls print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.

The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user. [click here](https://github.com/FrensiM/holbertonschool-shell/tree/main/permissions)
